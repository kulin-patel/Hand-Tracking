I have made hand-gesture-tracking. It processes the input from web camera.Then, It can identifies 21 landmark points of hands.
It runs on CPU. Not need for GPU. 
In this project, I have also added live FPS tracker too. It measure frame per Second on Webcam.
I have done this with OpenCV  and Mediapipe.
